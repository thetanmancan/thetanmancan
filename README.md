# About Me

<!--
**thetanmancan/thetanmancan** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

It takes analysis to understand something technically.
It takes empathy to understand something emotionally.
I do both. I understand.

I'm Tristan Camacho, an L.A.-based UX designer aiming to build products that help people build a better version of themselves.
I value integrity and compassion, and I believe the most important step in any process of change starts with understanding.
